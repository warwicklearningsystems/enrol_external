# External enrolment plugin for Moodle

Similar to manual enrolments but has a separate permission structure and doesn't allow user editing of assignments.  Changes can only be made via the web-services.

## Web services functions

This plugin implements an enrolment method with the following web services functions:

* enrol_external_list_instances - List all instances of the method in a course
* enrol_external_add_instance - Add an instance of the enrolment method to a course
* enrol_external_remove_instance - Removes an instance of the enrolment method from a course
* enrol_external_enrol_users - Enrol users into a course/enrolment instance.
* enrol_external_unenrol_users - Unenrols users from a course/enrolment instance.
